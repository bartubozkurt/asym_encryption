--Welcome to the Program!

--- Required Screenshots are located in the screenshot folder. You can read that as well as how the program works here ---

--The operation of the program is as follows;

--First of all, put the file you want to process into the program.

-- then if you don't have public and private key you should create public\private key
   To do this, you can press the [K] key from the Menu (*case sensitive.)

-- If you have a public\private key, you can continue with other operations from the menu. You don't need to create a key.

--To encrypt files;
  
-- You can press the [E] key to encrypt the file, then the program will give you
   It will ask for the location of the file you want to encrypt, what you need to pay attention to here,
   You must enter the full path to the file.

--For example, I want to encrypt a file named info.txt and I will give the exact location of this file to the program.

--The program will ask for the location of the public key, if you did not generate the key programmatically in this location, your own public\private key
  Enter the exact location of your file into the program. If you have already generated the key in the program, it will automatically create a public\private key for your folder.
  Give the program the exact location of this public key.

--Your file is encrypted!

-- and written to the encrypted file (*ex: info.txt --> info_encrypted.txt) like...

--For decryption;

-- Press [D] to decode

-- If you have a file that you encrypt later or that has already been encrypted, write its exact location

--Now enter the exact location of your private key

--Your File Has Been Decrypted!

--To sign;

--Press [S] to sign

-- It will write your signature to a file named signature.pub for you

--To verify signature;

--Press [V] to verify signature

--Signature will give feedback as valid or invalid.

Thanks !
